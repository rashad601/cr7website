<h2>Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi? The incredible goalscoring stat that could swing the argument</h2><div class="line"></div><div class="articleBody clear">	<figure>

<p>Cristiano Ronaldo arrived at the Juventus Stadium for the Italian giants’ first game after the European winter break with a retro 
  iPod Shuffle clipped to his tie and the classic Apple earphones dangling from his ears.
  But to say his first Serie A hat-trick was another example of him rolling back the years is hardly an accurate statement.
  
  Ronaldo, who turns 35 at the start of February, has actually enjoyed his most prolific goalscoring years since turning 30, 
  averaging 47.8 goals a season after that birthday (including the season he turned 30) compared to 34.5 goals a season before then.
  
  He has also won three Champions Leagues, one La Liga, a Serie A title, a Club World Cup, Italian Supercoppa, Euro 2016, the
   Nations League and two Ballon d’Or since turning 30.</p>

</figure><p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s double against Dortmund on Tuesday in the UEFA Champions League took his overall tally against German clubs to 25 in 20 appearances.</p>
<p>The name Cristiano Ronaldo is compatible with goals. And even though the Portuguese forward is yet to hit the ground running in La Liga this season, his form in the UEFA Champions League is simply awe-inspiring.

  Comparatively, it may seem a little ambiguous but there is hardly a player who can be said to love the European competition more than 
  the Real Madrid goal machine. And this narrative was, yet again, highlighted in the role he played in his side’s resounding victory at the Signal Iduna Park.</p>

</figure><p>The Portuguese superstar contributed his quota to emphatically obliterate Borussia Dortmund to commemorate his 400th career game.</p>
<p>Efficient. Precise. Emphatic. In a match as lively as this one, there was unquestionably one outcome assured: Cristiano Ronaldo highlighting his unfaltering dominance. It is pretty much a cliche; he loves the big stages and the big stages love him.

  It is one scenario to occasionally put in mind-boggling shifts for one’s club and another to consistently sustain such a high level of output for over a decade. The latter is the domain Cristiano Ronaldo finds himself in at the moment.
  
  Here are the top three feats sealed by Cristiano Ronaldo in Real Madrid’s 3:1 victory over Dortmund to memorialize a landmark of 400 games in his professional career.</p>

  </figure><p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s list of victims includes the likes of Argentina, Belgium, 2018 World Cup runners-up Croatia, Netherlands, and heavyweights Spain.</p>
  <p>Debunking the negative propaganda that “Ronaldo scores only against small teams” and “Ronaldo does not show up on the big stage”, f
    acts, stats, history and what have you prove the massive positive influence that the 34-year-old has had on his tiny Iberian country 
    since breaking into the senior team in August 2003. Following his first-ever Portugal goal, which occurred in an opening game defeat to eventual 
    champions Greece at Euro 2004, CR7 has transformed from a 19-year-old starlet to the best skipper in Europe and, arguably, the world.</p>

    <h2>AN ODE TO CRISTIANO RONALDO, 34 YEARS INTO HIS EXISTENCE</h2><div class="line"></div><div class="articleBody clear">

    </figure><p>Alien, out of this world… Cristiano Ronaldo’s 34th year on Planet Earth and 17th season as a professional footballer has us reminiscing.</p>
    <p>On 5th February, 1971 Astronauts landed on the moon in the Apollo 14 mission spacecraft. Being the third human mission to land on the moon and the first 
      one since the Apollo 13 mission that experienced a dangerous explosion in space was a glorifying moment for NASA. After all, it symbolized a sense of resilience 
      and an enviable ability to bounce back from adversity.

      Talking of resilience and an enviable ability to bounce back from adversity albeit this time in a different field devoid of space 
      ships and the near abstract world of exploring solar systems, the life and times of a footballing god named Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos 
      Aveiro comes to mind. From the obscurity of Madeira to the upper echelons of Manchester, Madrid and now Turin not forgetting a brief transit at Lisbon; 
      the maestro, affectionately called “C. Ro” or 
      “CR7” by his ardent fandom, has seen it all from the lows to the highs of the Beautiful Game.</p>

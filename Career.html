<p>Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal at the 2001 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival, 
  debuting in a 3–1 defeat to Finland. The following year he would represent his country under-17 side at the 2002 UEFA 
  European Under-17 Football Championship, where they failed to progress past the group stage. Ronaldo also featured in the 
  Olympic squad at the 2004 Summer Olympics, scoring one goal in the tournament, though the team was eliminated in the first round, 
  finishing bottom of their group with three points after 4–2 defeats to eventual semi-finalists Iraq and quarter-finalists Costa Rica.
   During his international youth career, Ronaldo would go on
   to represent the under-15 team, under-17, under-20, under-21, and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.</p>

<h2>2007–12: Assuming the captaincy</h2><div class="line"></div><div class="articleBody clear"></div>
<p>One day after his 22nd birthday, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game
   against Brazil on 6 February 2007, as requested by Portuguese Football Federation president Carlos Silva, 
   who had died two days earlier. Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time.
    While he scored eight goals in the qualification, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, 
    netting the second goal of their 3–1 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic; in the same game, he also set-up 
    Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance.
   Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3–2 loss against eventual finalists Germany.</p>

<p>During the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals.
   A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap. 
   His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he found the net three times in 
   a 15-minute spell of a 4–2 qualifying victory on 6 September 2013.[299] After Portugal failed to qualify 
   during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden –
    billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimović – which ensured their place at the tournament.
     His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equaling Pauleta's record. Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5–1
   friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.</p>

  <p>Following the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo scored six goals in the opening rounds of the 2018 FIFA World Cup 
    qualifiers with four being against Andorra and two against Latvia. These goals brought his international 
    tally to 68 goals, putting level with Gerd Müller and Robbie Keane as the fourth-highest European international
     goalscorer of all-time. He played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017
      at age 32, opening a 2–3 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Estádio dos Barreiros. With the goal, 
    he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.</p>
    <p>In Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June,
       Cristiano Ronaldo set-up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2–2 draw. Three days later, 
       he scored in a 1–0 win over hosts Russia. On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a
        4–0 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition. 
        With his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled Sándor Kocsis as the second-highest European international 
        goalscorer of all-time, behind only Ferenc Puskás. He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's 
        group stage matches. Ronaldo left the competition early: after Chile defeated Portugal 3–0 on penalties 
        in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children. Therefore, he missed Portugal's 
      third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2–1 after extra time.</p>
